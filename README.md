# Pomodoro

###
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. For many people, time is an enemy. 
The anxiety triggered by “the ticking clock”, especially when it involves a deadline, leads to ineffective work and 
study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.

The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way 
we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.
